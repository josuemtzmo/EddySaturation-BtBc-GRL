# Eddy Saturation: Barotropic vs Baroclinic

A manuscript investigating the relative importance of baroclinic and barotropic eddy saturation in a zonally re-entrant channel on a beta-plane.

Constantinou, N. C. and A. McC. Hogg (2019). Eddy saturation of the Southern Ocean: a baroclinic versus barotropic perspective. _Geophys. Res. Lett._ (in press, arXiv:[1906.08442][arXiv:1906.08442]).

Simulations were performed using GFDL's [Modular Ocean Model version 6](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6). Input and configuration files can be found in repo [EddySaturation-MOM6](https://github.com/navidcy/EddySaturation-MOM6).
